Trip Planner is a web application that provides the user with the option to enter a
destination or select from recently entered user destinations, select an activity type, and
choose from nearby activities based on the type that they may wish to visit. We have
utitized Node.js via EJS to provide for a consistent user experience and layout throughout
the website. For the backend, a MySQL database connection is used to store and provide
CRUD capabilities for the web application. Also we have linked with the Bing Maps, Yelp,
and PositionStack APIs to deliver appropriate content for the website. Allows for emailing of trip to any email.
